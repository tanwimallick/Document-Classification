    "# LLM in-context learning experiment\n",
    "In-context learning is an interesting emergent property of LLMs where an LLM can perform a task simply by being prompted input-output values, without optimizing any parameters (like one might do with fine-tuning). For more information, see this [blog post](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/) from Stanford AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "> During in-context learning, we give the LM a prompt that consists of a list of input-output pairs that demonstrate a task. At the end of the prompt, we append a test input and allow the LM to make a prediction just by conditioning on the prompt and predicting the next tokens. To correctly answer the two prompts below, the model needs to read the training examples to figure out the input distribution (financial or general news), output distribution (Positive/Negative or topic), input-output mapping (sentiment or topic classification), and the formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-context learning is competitive with models trained on labeled data. It typically requires very few labeled data examples. We know that few-shot learning is also probably effective for classification; see this [experiment](https://snorkel.ai/few-shot-learning-large-language-models/) conducted by Snorkel AI, where even 3 shots (examples) performed at a higher level than an LLM trained on none.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous experiment with a \"vanilla\" Llama 3 (no fine-tuning or in-context learning) still performed somewhat well, with an accuracy of 68% and a recall of 96%. We notice, however, that its precision (55%) is quite low, which suggests that we need to help it get better at identifying non-CS articles articles correctly. In-context learning can help us do that, allowing us to increase the precision and accuracy."

    "Abstract: \"We present numerical evidence that most two-dimensional surface states of a bulk topological superconductor (TSC) sit at an integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We study TSC surface states in class CI with quenched disorder. Low-energy (finite-energy) surface states were expected to be critically delocalized (Anderson localized). We confirm the low-energy picture, but find instead that finite-energy states are also delocalized, with universal statistics that are independent of the TSC winding number, and consistent with the spin quantum Hall plateau transition (percolation).\"\n",

    "Abstract: \"In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on radial symmetry center method to track colloidal particles close to contact, where the optical images of the particles start to overlap in digital video microscopy. This overlapping effect is important to observe the pair interaction potential in colloidal studies and it appears as additional interaction in the measurement of the interaction with conventional tracking analysis. The proposed algorithm in this work is simple, fast and applicable for not only two particles but also three and more particles without any modification. The algorithm uses gradient vectors of the particle intensity distribution, which allows us to use a part of the symmetric intensity distribution in the calculation of the actual particle position. In this study, simulations are performed to see the performance of the proposed algorithm for two and three particles, where the simulation images are generated by using fitted curve to experimental particle image for different sized particles. As a result, the algorithm yields the maximum error smaller than 2 nm for 5.53 mu silica particles in contact condition.\"\n",

    "Abstract: \"Queueing networks are systems of theoretical interest that give rise to complex families of stochastic processes, and find widespread use in the performance evaluation of interconnected resources. Yet, despite their importance within applications, and in comparison to their counterpart stochastic models in genetics or mathematical biology, there exist few relevant approaches for transient inference and uncertainty quantification tasks in these systems. This is a consequence of strong computational impediments and distinctive properties of the Markov jump processes induced by queueing networks. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview of the inferential challenge and its comparison to analogue tasks within related mathematical domains. We then discuss a model augmentation over an approximating network system, and present a flexible and scalable variational Bayesian framework, which is targeted at general-form open and closed queueing systems, with varied service disciplines and priorities. The inferential procedure is finally validated in a couple of uncertainty quantification tasks for network service rates.\"\n",

    "Abstract: \"We construct Hall algebra of elliptic curve over $\\\\mathbb F_1$ using the theory of monoidal scheme due to Deitmar and the theory of Hall algebra for monoidal representations due to Szczesny. The resulting algebra is shown to be a specialization of elliptic Hall algebra studied by Burban and Schiffmann. Thus our algebra is isomorphic to the skein algebra for torus by the recent work of Morton and Samuelson.\"\n",

Of late, even more flexible methods based on machine learning methods\\nhave been developed for statistical adjustment.

In this article, we use a different research\\ndesign to compare matching with covariate prioritization to black box methods.\\nWe use black box methods to replicate results from five studies where matching\\nwith covariate prioritization was used to customize the statistical adjustment\\nin direct response to substantive expertise.

       "'  We present a systematic global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method\\nwhich can be utilized to rank the variables that affect two quantity of\\ninterests -- pore pressure depletion and stress change -- around a\\nhydraulically-fractured horizontal well based on their degree of importance.\\nThese variables include rock properties and stimulation design variables. A\\nfully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore\\npressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost\\nof a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used\\nto replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,\\nfor calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around\\nhydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,\\nproduction pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the\\nchanges in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of\\neach parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic\\nfractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect\\nof mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)\\nThese two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large\\ndistances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture\\ntips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and\\nhalf-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.\\nThe results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation\\ndesign of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill\\ndrilling.\\n'"

    "Incredible! The model does as good or better on virtually every metric compared to the vanilla LLM model. We see a 14-point increase in accuracy, an almost 25-point increase in precision, a slight decrease in recall (96% to 91%), and an increase in F1-score to 0.81 (from 0.7).\n",

    "Notably, this model also beats the previous Snorkel semantic similarity approach, with an increase in every metric. This is the best model by far. Some potential next steps:\n",
    "1. In its output, the model also produced a \"reason\" for most of its labels. It would be interesting to look at its \"reason\" for articles it mis-classified and see if that might inform how we structure the prompt.\n",
    "2. I didn't quite do this in the correct way. I used one prompt on the first 25 items, found that it performed badly, and modified the prompt based on those results. Obviously, the model performed well on the \"unseen\" data (25-200) but there is a small worry that it \"overfitted\" on the first 25.\n",
    "3. Increasing the prompt length increases the runtime, but it might also make the model even more accurate. Nevertheless, my guess is that 50% of the misclassified entries are actually quite difficult to classify as CS, even for a human. In that way, maybe we should be happy with the 84% accuracy."
