    "# LLM in-context learning experiment - Llama 3 70B (work)\n",
    "Our previous in-context learning experiment showed that the method was very effective, achieving high levels of accuracy compared to its \"vanilla\" model and scoring well on virtually all metrics. However, we also have seen that the Llama 3 70B model performs better than 8B in-context learning without *any* prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or in-context learning whatsoever!\n",

We confirm the low-energy picture, but find instead that finite-energy states are also delocalized, with universal statistics that are independent of the TSC winding number, and consistent with the spin quantum Hall plateau transition (percolation).\"\n",

We assess the model by testing its out-of-sample predictions for the direction of price moves given the history of price and order flow, across a wide range of stocks and time periods. The universal price formation model is shown to exhibit a remarkably stable out-of-sample prediction accuracy across time, for a wide range of stocks from different sectors. Interestingly, these results also hold for stocks which are not part of the training sample, showing that the relations captured by the model are universal and not asset-specific.\"\n",

A social network analysis of faculty hires can reveal important patterns in an academic field, such as the existence of a hierarchy or sociological aspects such as the presence of communities of departments. We first statistically test for the existence of a linear hierarchy in the network and for its steepness. We find a near linear hierarchical order of the departments, proposing a new index for hiring networks, which we contrast with other indicators of hierarchy, including published rankings.\"\n",

    "Abstract: \"We present numerical evidence that most two-dimensional surface states of a bulk topological superconductor (TSC) sit at an integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We study TSC surface states in class CI with quenched disorder. Low-energy (finite-energy) surface states were expected to be critically delocalized (Anderson localized). We confirm the low-energy picture, but find instead that finite-energy states are also delocalized, with universal statistics that are independent of the TSC winding number, and consistent with the spin quantum Hall plateau transition (percolation).\"\n",

    "Abstract: \"Using a large-scale Deep Learning approach applied to a high-frequency database containing billions of electronic market quotes and transactions for US equities, we uncover nonparametric evidence for the existence of a universal and stationary price formation mechanism relating the dynamics of supply and demand for a stock, as revealed through the order book, to subsequent variations in its market price. We assess the model by testing its out-of-sample predictions for the direction of price moves given the history of price and order flow, across a wide range of stocks and time periods. The universal price formation model is shown to exhibit a remarkably stable out-of-sample prediction accuracy across time, for a wide range of stocks from different sectors. Interestingly, these results also hold for stocks which are not part of the training sample, showing that the relations captured by the model are universal and not asset-specific.\"\n",

A social network analysis of faculty hires can reveal important patterns in an academic field, such as the existence of a hierarchy or sociological aspects such as the presence of communities of departments. We first statistically test for the existence of a linear hierarchy in the network and for its steepness. We find a near linear hierarchical order of the departments, proposing a new index for hiring networks, which we contrast with other indicators of hierarchy, including published rankings.\"\n",
